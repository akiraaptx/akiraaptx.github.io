<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>New-sytle Signal and Slot Support</h2>
<p>One of the key features of Qt is its use of signals and slots to communicate between objects. Their use encourages the development of reusable components.</p>

<p>A signal is emitted when something of potential interest happens. A slot is a Python callable. If a signal is connected to a slot then the slot is called when the signal is emitted. If a signal isn’t connected then nothing happens. The code (or component) that emits the signal does not know or care if the signal is being used.</p>

<ul>
<li>A signal may be connected to many slots.</li>
<li>A signal may also be connected to another signal.</li>
<li>Signal arguments may be any Python type.</li>
<li>A slot may be connected to many signals.</li>
<li>Connections may be direct (ie. synchronous) or queued (ie. asynchronous).</li>
<li>Connections may be made across threads.</li>
<li>Signals may be disconnected.</li>
</ul>

<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unbound and Bound Signals</h3>

<p>A signal (specifically an unbound signal) is an attribute of a class that is a sub-class of QObject. When a signal is referenced as an attribute of an instance of the class then PyQt4 automatically binds the instance to the signal in order to create a bound signal. This is the same mechanism that Python itself uses to create bound methods from class functions.</p>

<p>A bound signal has connect(), disconnect() and emit() methods that implement the associated functionality. It also has a signal attribute that is the signature of the signal that would be returned by Qt’s SIGNAL() macro.</p>

<p>A signal may be overloaded, ie. a signal with a particular name may support more than one signature. A signal may be indexed with a signature in order to select the one required. A signature is a sequence of types. A type is either a Python type object or a string that is the name of a C++ type. The name of a C++ type is automatically normalised so that, for example, QString can be used instead of the non-normalised const QString &.</p>

<p>If a signal is overloaded then it will have a default that will be used if no index is given.</p>

<p>When a signal is emitted then any arguments are converted to C++ types if possible. If an argument doesn’t have a corresponding C++ type then it is wrapped in a special C++ type that allows it to be passed around Qt’s meta-type system while ensuring that its reference count is properly maintained.</p>

<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Defining New Signals with pyqtSignal( )</h3>
<p>PyQt4 automatically defines signals for all Qt’s built-in signals. New signals can be defined as class attributes using the pyqtSignal() factory.</p>

The following example shows the definition of a number of new signals:
<pre><code class="language-python">
from PyQt4.QtCore import QObject, pyqtSignal

class Foo(QObject):

    # This defines a signal called 'closed' that takes no arguments.
    closed = pyqtSignal()

    # This defines a signal called 'rangeChanged' that takes two
    # integer arguments.
    range_changed = pyqtSignal(int, int, name='rangeChanged')

    # This defines a signal called 'valueChanged' that has two overloads,
    # one that takes an integer argument and one that takes a QString
    # argument.  Note that because we use a string to specify the type of
    # the QString argument then this code will run under Python v2 and v3.
    valueChanged = pyqtSignal([int], ['QString'])</code></pre>

The following code demostrates the definition, connection and emit of a signal without arguments:
<pre><code class="language-python">
from PyQt4.QtCore import QObject, pyqtSignal

class Foo(QObject):

    # Define a new signal called 'trigger' that has no arguments.
    trigger = pyqtSignal()

    def connect_and_emit_trigger(self):
        # Connect the trigger signal to a slot.
        self.trigger.connect(self.handle_trigger)

        # Emit the signal.
        self.trigger.emit()

    def handle_trigger(self):
        # Show that the slot has been called.

        print "trigger signal received"</code></pre>

The following code demonstrates the connection of overloaded signals:
<pre><code class="language-python">
from PyQt4.QtGui import QComboBox

class Bar(QComboBox):

    def connect_activated(self):
        # The PyQt4 documentation will define what the default overload is.
        # In this case it is the overload with the single integer argument.
        self.activated.connect(self.handle_int)

        # For non-default overloads we have to specify which we want to
        # connect.  In this case the one with the single string argument.
        # (Note that we could also explicitly specify the default if we
        # wanted to.)
        self.activated[str].connect(self.handle_string)

    def handle_int(self, index):
        print "activated signal passed integer", index

    def handle_string(self, text):
        print "activated signal passed QString", text</code></pre>
