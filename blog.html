<p>Having been The United States for almost half year, have many first experience, happy or sad, there are all my valuable treasure.</p>

EMC is the best class I ever have, especially when it comes to our Professor Mark Steffark. He is a very good speaker, he can always attrack our attention, and control this semester's classes  in a good pace. I never learn something about EMC before, but during the class time, I gradually fall in love with this field. EMC can be a very applicationable field, which combine all the knowledge I have learned before, for example: digital and analog circuit, high frequency circuit, and so on. By studing this class, I realized that all what I have learned before can be used in some many different way, and what more important is that there are still so many problems which I should take care of when you make your own project or application.

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is a true friend for me?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
