<h2>
<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>New-sytle Signal and Slot Support</h2>
<p>One of the key features of Qt is its use of signals and slots to communicate between objects. Their use encourages the development of reusable components.</p>

<p>A signal is emitted when something of potential interest happens. A slot is a Python callable. If a signal is connected to a slot then the slot is called when the signal is emitted. If a signal isn’t connected then nothing happens. The code (or component) that emits the signal does not know or care if the signal is being used.</p>

<ul>
<li>A signal may be connected to many slots.</li>
<li>A signal may also be connected to another signal.</li>
<li>Signal arguments may be any Python type.</li>
<li>A slot may be connected to many signals.</li>
<li>Connections may be direct (ie. synchronous) or queued (ie. asynchronous).</li>
<li>Connections may be made across threads.</li>
<li>Signals may be disconnected.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unbound and Bound Signals</h3>

<p>A signal (specifically an unbound signal) is an attribute of a class that is a sub-class of QObject. When a signal is referenced as an attribute of an instance of the class then PyQt4 automatically binds the instance to the signal in order to create a bound signal. This is the same mechanism that Python itself uses to create bound methods from class functions.</p>

<p>A bound signal has connect(), disconnect() and emit() methods that implement the associated functionality. It also has a signal attribute that is the signature of the signal that would be returned by Qt’s SIGNAL() macro.</p>

<p>A signal may be overloaded, ie. a signal with a particular name may support more than one signature. A signal may be indexed with a signature in order to select the one required. A signature is a sequence of types. A type is either a Python type object or a string that is the name of a C++ type. The name of a C++ type is automatically normalised so that, for example, QString can be used instead of the non-normalised const QString &.</p>

<p>If a signal is overloaded then it will have a default that will be used if no index is given.</p>

<p>When a signal is emitted then any arguments are converted to C++ types if possible. If an argument doesn’t have a corresponding C++ type then it is wrapped in a special C++ type that allows it to be passed around Qt’s meta-type system while ensuring that its reference count is properly maintained.</p>

<h3>
<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Defining New Signals with pyqtSignal( )</h3>
<p>PyQt4 automatically defines signals for all Qt’s built-in signals. New signals can be defined as class attributes using the pyqtSignal() factory.</p>

The following example shows the definition of a number of new signals:
<pre><code class="language-python">
from PyQt4.QtCore import QObject, pyqtSignal

class Foo(QObject):

    # This defines a signal called 'closed' that takes no arguments.
    closed = pyqtSignal()

    # This defines a signal called 'rangeChanged' that takes two
    # integer arguments.
    range_changed = pyqtSignal(int, int, name='rangeChanged')

    # This defines a signal called 'valueChanged' that has two overloads,
    # one that takes an integer argument and one that takes a QString
    # argument.  Note that because we use a string to specify the type of
    # the QString argument then this code will run under Python v2 and v3.
    valueChanged = pyqtSignal([int], ['QString'])</code></pre>

The following code demostrates the definition, connection and emit of a signal without arguments:
<pre><code class="language-python">
from PyQt4.QtCore import QObject, pyqtSignal

class Foo(QObject):

    # Define a new signal called 'trigger' that has no arguments.
    trigger = pyqtSignal()

    def connect_and_emit_trigger(self):
        # Connect the trigger signal to a slot.
        self.trigger.connect(self.handle_trigger)

        # Emit the signal.
        self.trigger.emit()

    def handle_trigger(self):
        # Show that the slot has been called.

        print "trigger signal received"</code></pre>

The following code demonstrates the connection of overloaded signals:
<pre><code class="language-python">
from PyQt4.QtGui import QComboBox

class Bar(QComboBox):

    def connect_activated(self):
        # The PyQt4 documentation will define what the default overload is.
        # In this case it is the overload with the single integer argument.
        self.activated.connect(self.handle_int)

        # For non-default overloads we have to specify which we want to
        # connect.  In this case the one with the single string argument.
        # (Note that we could also explicitly specify the default if we
        # wanted to.)
        self.activated[str].connect(self.handle_string)

    def handle_int(self, index):
        print "activated signal passed integer", index

    def handle_string(self, text):
        print "activated signal passed QString", text</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Connecting a Signal to a Slot</h3>
Connection is performed to enable particular events call their respective slots. All QObject derived classes support connections of signals and slots. Simple synta of the <strong>connect()</strong> method:
<pre><code class="language-python">object.connect(Signal_Widget, Signal, Slot_Widget, Slot)
</code></pre>
The <strong>connect()</strong> function makes a connection using two sets of parameters:
<ul>
  <li>"signal" set
    <ul>
      <li>Consists of the signalling object and the type of signal you wish to handle (Given by SIGNAL(QString)).</li>
      <li>Every widget emits a signal upon an event like a user interaction or timer generated.</li>
      <li>These signals are not to be confused with POSIX/UNIX signals, that's a wholly different OS-level concept.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> "slot" set
    <ul>
      <li>The receiving object, and the slot it must execute upon the signal (Given by SLOT(QString)).</li>
      <li>Every emitted signal can be handled by a function, called in PyQt-lingo as a "slot".</li>
      <li>A slot is executed each time the signal connected to it is emitted by the signalling class.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a name="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Passing Arguments to Slots</h3>
Signals and Slots can also carry parameters. This is useful when there's an input involved, or when there needs to be some data sent automatically each time an event occurs.

<pre><code class="language-python"># Program 03 - Signals and Slots with Arguments
from PyQt4.QtCore import SIGNAL, SLOT
from PyQt4.QtGui import QApplication, QWidget,\
    QLineEdit, QLabel, QHBoxLayout
import sys
 
if __name__=='__main__':
    App = QApplication(sys.argv)
    Window = QWidget()
    Window.setWindowTitle("Arguments")
    Layout = QHBoxLayout(Window)
    # Create a Layout Object, attached to the Window.
    Line = QLineEdit()
    # Create a Line-Editor / Text-Box.
    Layout.addWidget(Line)
    # Add it to the HBox Layout.
    Label = QLabel()
    Layout.addWidget(Label)
    Line.connect(Line, SIGNAL("textChanged(QString)"),\
        Label, SLOT("setText(QString)"))
    # Connect the required signal and slot.
    Window.show()
    App.exec_()
</code></pre>
When the user enters/modifies the text of the QLineEdit widget a textChnaged(QString) signal is emitted with the new modified string loaded into it. We intercept this and connect it to the QLabel's setText(QString) function/slot. Thus the changed QString travels from the QLineEdit to QLabel and is set for display, all upon a single character modification!


<h2>
<a name="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Writing Custom Signals in PyQt</h2>
Writing custom signals that you want to 'emit' or trigger during certain events is an easy task. You need to create your signal object first. This is done using the PyQt.QtCore provided <strong>pyqtSignal()</strong> function. Its signature is given as:
<pre><code class="language-python"> QtCore.pyqtSignal([optional argument type], [optional name])
</code></pre>
We need to create a signal object using this signal as a property in out class, then call its connect and emit methods to actually use it. If I were to explain diagrammatically:
<ul>
  <li> Create the signal object with pyqtSignal()</li>
  <li> Connect the signal to a slot with signalObj.connect(slot)</li>
  <li> Emit the signal with signalObj.emit(optionalArgs)</li>  
</ul>
The following code sample explains three types of signals:
<ul>
  <li> Signals with no arguments (simpleSig) </li>
  <li> Signals with some arguments (2, argumentSig) </li>
  <li> Signals with multiple-type (overloaded) arguments (int and QString, doubleSig) </li>  
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-python"># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
 
import sys
 
class MyWidget(QWidget):
 
    # Defining signals below:
 
    # No arguments, its a simple signal that can
    # be emitted.
    simpleSig = pyqtSignal()
 
    # A signal that requires two parameters.
    # (One is an integer, other is a Python list type)
    # You can have one or more than two as well.
    argumentSig = pyqtSignal(int, list)
 
    # A signal that allows two different sets of params.
    # One is if you send an int, the other is for QString.
    # This signal is also optionally named using 'name'
    # for use in more dynamic purposes.
    doubleSig = pyqtSignal((int,), (QString,), name='doubles')
 
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        # Construct the parent, never forget this!
        super(MyWidget, self).__init__(parent)
 
        # Connect our signals to their slots
        self.simpleSig.connect(self.simpleSlot)
        self.argumentSig.connect(self.argumentSlot)
        # We have same slot for the double signals
        # (aka) overloaded signals.
        # Cause we can check the argument from within too!
        self.doubleSig['int'].connect(self.doubleSlot)
        self.doubleSig['QString'].connect(self.doubleSlot)
 
        # Connect our button to a slot which
        # will call the signals.
        self.button = QPushButton('Press me', self)
        self.button.clicked.connect(self.buttonClicked)
 
    def buttonClicked(self, checked=False):
        # Emit the various signals to use them.
        self.simpleSig.emit()
        self.argumentSig.emit(2, [1,2,3])
        # Overloaded signals have the following format
        # for emitting specifically.
        self.doubleSig['int'].emit(42)
        self.doubleSig['QString'].emit('Hitchhiking a ride.')
 
    # Defining custom-signal slots below:
 
    def simpleSlot(self):
        # Takes no arguments
        print "Simple custom signal:",
        print "No arguments in this type of signal."
 
    def argumentSlot(self, *args):
        # ( Can also be 'argumentSlot(self, intArg, listArg)' )
        # Has two arguments anyway, which is collected into one
        # using '*' (A Python feature)
        print "Multi-argument signal:",
        print "Two arguments were passed: value: '%d' of %s and value: '%s' of %s." % (args[0], type(args[0]), args[1], type(args[1]))
 
    def doubleSlot(self, someArgument):
        # This slot handles both doubleSig(int)
        # and doubleSig(QString)
        print "Overloaded signal:",
        print "An argument was passed and it was of '%s' and value: '%s'." % (type(someArgument), someArgument)
 
if __name__=='__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    widget = MyWidget()
    widget.show()
    app.exec_()
